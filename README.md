# complex-hsv

Graph complex functions using hsv colors.

The idea here is we graph the inputs on a normal plane, and then
the outputs using hue and saturation (polar: hue = theta, sat = r).
Perhaps more robust systems exist; I'm not well versed in the study
of complex functions, but maybe this will be helpful.

Still very much in early stages. A lot of stack template dummy code. Which, helpfully,
came with instructions:

## Execute

* Run `stack exec -- complex-hsv-exe` to see "We're inside the application!"
* With `stack exec -- complex-hsv-exe --verbose` you will see the same message, with more logging.

## Run tests

`stack test`
